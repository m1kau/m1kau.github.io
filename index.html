      <h1>The History and Evolution of Web Browsers</h1>
        <p>
          People often overlook web browsers, but they are one of the most important tools for using the internet. 
		  Browsers started out as simple programs that only showed text and links, but they grew into complex platforms 
		  that power almost everything we do online. This site shows how they developed, beginning with Tim Berners-Lee’s 
		  first browser at CERN, followed by Mosaic making the web easier to use, and Netscape pushing new ideas like JavaScript. 
		  It also covers the browser wars when Internet Explorer took over, the rise of Firefox and Safari, and the release of Chrome that 
		  reshaped the market. Today browsers are not just page viewers, they run advanced apps, protect privacy, and continue 
		  to decide how people reach the web.
