      <h1>Early Browsers</h1>

      <!--Info about WorldWideWeb Browser-->
      <h2>WorldWideWeb (Nexus), 1990</h2>
        <div class="images">
          <img src="css/images/nexus.png" alt="WorldWideWeb/Nexus"/>
            <div>
              <p>
                  Tim Berners-Lee created the first web browser at CERN in 1990. He first called it
				  WorldWideWeb and later renamed it Nexus. It showed documents and links, and it
				  could even edit pages inside the browser, something modern browsers do not do.
				  Although it only ran on NeXT computers and felt extremely limited compared to
				  todays standards, it introduced the core ideas that define the entire web:
				  hyperlink navigation, a universal URL system, and a basic way to structure
				  information using HTML. Nexus was not meant for the general public but served as
				  a proof of concept that a global, interconnected system of documents was possible.
				  This early prototype laid the foundation for every browser that followed.
            <ul>
              <li>First browser and editor</li>
              <li>Used early web pieces: URL, HTML, HTTP</li>
              <li>NeXTSTEP computers only</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

      <!--Info about Mosiac Browser-->
      <h2>NCSA Mosaic, 1993</h2>
        <div class="images">
          <img src="css/images/mosaic.png" alt="NCSA Mosaic"/>
            <div>
              <p>
				  In 1993 the team at NCSA released Mosaic. It ran on Windows, Mac, and Unix,
				  installed easily, and most importantly showed pictures inline with the text.
				  That single feature changed how people experienced the web by making it feel
				  more visual and easier to understand. Mosaic also introduced interface elements
				  that users still expect today such as navigation buttons, scrollbars, colored
				  hyperlinks, and bookmarks. These improvements helped everyday users explore
				  the web without needing any technical knowledge. Mosaic became the first browser
				  to gain real mainstream attention, turning the internet from an academic tool
				  into something millions of people wanted to use.
            <ul>
              <li>Inline images with text</li>
              <li>Simple toolbar and bookmarks</li>
              <li>Crossplatform (Windows/Mac/Unix)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>  

      <!--Info about Netscape Browser-->
      <h2>Netscape Navigator, 1994</h2>
        <div class="images">
          <img src="css/images/netscape.png" alt="Netscape Navigator"/>
            <div>
              <p>
				  After leaving NCSA, Marc Andreessen helped launch Netscape Communications.
				  Netscape Navigator released in 1994 and quickly took over the browser market.
				  It offered faster performance, smoother graphics, and a more refined interface
				  compared to Mosaic. Netscape introduced several new ideas, including the creation
				  of JavaScript in 1995, which allowed websites to react to user actions instead of
				  remaining static. Navigator became the browser of choice for businesses, schools,
				  and home internet users during the mid 1990s. Its fast growth proved how important
				  browsers were becoming and set the stage for the competition that would soon
				  start the first browser war.
              <ul>
                <li>Performance and polish</li>
                <li>Introduced JavaScript (1995)</li>
                <li>Dominant mid 90s browser</li>
            </ul>
